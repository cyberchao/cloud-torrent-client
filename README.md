#Cloud-Torrent-Client

A tool to download files to local storage that have been downloaded by cloud-torrent.
Automatically download, decompress, delete remote files and torrents

Cloud-torrent server side must deploy what I have optimized, that added some functions to get the torrent downloading status and delete
